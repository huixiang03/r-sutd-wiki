## Version Control in r/sutd subreddit wiki 



Welcome!!! HAHA

This repo is to control for the current reddit wiki. 

For non-mod who wants to contribute, you can branch them and merge if required, and moderators here will look through the moderate accordingly HAHA!



**Rule of Thumbs**

Please clearly state reasons of the git merge, rather than "updated", "next version", "new commit". Like, please make our life easier la. HAHA!

Add Folders, and pages if necessary



**What you can use:**

Reddit does not allow:

- underlined:```<u> <u/> ```
- dropdowns:``` <details><details/>```

If you want to refer in details, or your want to contribute refer [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/markdown)!

I know... I know... There are some things you cannot do. But I think reddit is slowly improving?



And most of all, HAVE FUN!!! Spread (happinesss) Until Dawn
