# Recommended Laptop Specs

Welcome to the laptop specs page! This page will note down some of the software used by students in the various pillars, with links provided to their respective system requirements (if applicable). These requirements will form the basis for our recommended laptop specs for each pillar, although your mileage may vary. A quick description of the laptop specs we refer to are listed at the very bottom of this page if you’re interested!

In addition to the specs we refer to below, do also consider other factors when deciding which laptop to purchase. These factors include screen size, weight, and battery life, which will contribute to your quality of life, but are less quantifiable and more subjective.
