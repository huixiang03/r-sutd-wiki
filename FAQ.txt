# FAQ

## Applying to SUTD

**Rate my chances of getting in?**

We do not know whether or not you’re going to get in. We are not omniscient beings. Be patient and wait for the email from admissions.

**Help! My admission application...**

If you face any issues in your application, it is best to contact the Office of Admissions. While fellow applicants may be able to offer some help, they are no substitute for the Office of Admissions.

**How do we choose our pillar?**

In the middle of Term 3, the school will ask you to indicate your preferred pillar. At the end of Term 3, they will ask you to confirm your decision, whether it was your previous selection or another pillar altogether.

If you wish to switch pillars afterwards, you may write in to the Office of Student Administration before Term 4 starts. Once Term 4 starts, you will still have 1-2 weeks to switch, but please note that you may only do so once.

**Can I really choose any pillar?**

Yes, unless there is a policy change which we cannot predict. There is no sort of cut-off grade, and you will get what you select.

However, for the Freshmore intakes starting from AY2020, please note that one of the four Freshmore electives, namely Data Driven World, has been listed as a prerequisite for three of the core ISTD modules (1) (2) (3). This means that it is necessary for students to have taken Data Driven World before they can embark on Term 4/Sophomore in ISTD.

**How many focus tracks can we take?**

You may take multiple focus tracks in ESD and ISTD as long as you can fulfil their respective requirements. Unfortunately, multiple focus tracks in EPD is not possible at the moment. Do note that taking a focus track is not necessary (though your pillar’s admin staff may ask you to declare your study plan), and you may pick and choose your modules as long as you fulfil each module’s prerequisites.

Focus tracks are not applicable to ASD, and currently does not seem to be applicable to DAI.

**What is a HASS minor and what are the benefits of taking a HASS minor?**

After Freshmore where one is required to take the Humanities, Arts & Social Sciences (HASS) courses World Texts & Interpretations and Theorizing Society, Self and Culture, the HASS minor is an option to undertake a curated set of courses in the HASS pillar. 
Students have the opportunity to choose between the Design, Technology and Society (DTS) minor or the Digital Humanities (DH) minor by declaring it on the student portal before the start of Term 4.

For the Design, Technology and Society minor, the core course is 02.147TS Interventions in Design, Technology and Society, while for the Digital Humanities minor the core course is 02.137DH Introduction to Digital Humanities: Principles and Methods.

To have an idea of the curated set of courses each minor has to offer, the course codes of the HASS electives that count towards the DTS and DH minor end with ‘TS’ and ‘DH’ respectively. Course codes ending with ‘HT’ can also be counted towards both the DTS and DH minors. 

The key benefits of taking a HASS minor would be that you would be able to indicate your HASS course choice ahead of the rest of the student population. HASS minors are also different from pillar minors as they do not require the student to overload any courses to meet the prerequisites for the minor.

**Who will my Freshmore roommate be?**

After accepting your offer for SUTD, you will need to complete a bunch of tasks. One of these tasks is a survey regarding your lifestyle habits, such as your preferred air con temperature at night, the time at which you sleep/wake up, and whether you smoke or not. Using these survey results, the Office of Housing will run a program to allocate roommates with similar lifestyle habits. Your roommate will be one of your classmates, or from the class next door, but their exact identity will only be revealed when you meet them in person on check-in day.
